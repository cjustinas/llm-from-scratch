# LLM from Scratch

A personal project to develop a deeper understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs) by implementing one from scratch.

## Project Overview

This project aims to:
- Build a transformer-based language model from the ground up
- Understand the core components of modern LLMs
- Explore key concepts like:
  - Attention mechanisms
  - Token embeddings
  - Position encodings
  - Self-attention layers
  - Feed-forward networks
  - Training and optimization techniques

## Purpose

This is a learning-focused project to gain hands-on experience with the fundamental concepts behind Large Language Models. By building an LLM from scratch, the goal is to develop a deeper understanding of how these models work under the hood.
